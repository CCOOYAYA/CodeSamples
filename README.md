# CodeSamples
  This page is created by Cai Yingcheng to show the code samples and writing samples.  
  
  The first one is the small commodity trading system using MySQL database. You need to import this project into Eclipse IDE and find src/run/GO.java to run it. You can browse the sheet created by the database by using any MySQL database browser like Navicat for MySQL. The default administrator account is 111 and password is 1111.  
  
  The second is a C++ program for managing students' grades.
